                    <p>Designing the information architecture for SSgA's <a href="https://spdru.com/etfed" target="_blank">SPDR ETF Ed</a> was a fun project because 
                       I was given the responsibility of applying the heuristic and usability principles that 
                       I'm a student and practitioner of. The exercise of trying to solve the problems and pain
                       points of the many financial advisors and stakeholders that our team interviewed was 
                       challenging and satisfying to crack, and the project also gave me a chance to really 
                       learn Adobe Fireworks and InDesign. Below are some examples of the wireframes that I 
                       constructed and handed off to our development team.

                    <p>I produced the responsive site for the Big LoJack Arrow Campaign, which accepted user photo
                       entries to win contest prizes such as a Samsung Smart TV. Users also had the option of entering by MMS on the go.
                    </p>
                    <p>People were driven to our site by online banner ads, but more importantly from our street teams roaming
