                    <h3>LoJack's biglojackarrow.com</h3>
                    <p>In addition to serving as UX Designer on biglojackarrow.com, I also produced the digital offerings of the campaign, which included
                       online banners, a microsite that served as a hub for the campaign as well as a contest entry point, and finally a service to enter by SMS.
                    </p>
                    <p>People were driven to the site by the online banner ads, but more importantly from our street teams roaming
                       LoJack's 4 biggest markets in cars with 6 foot flashing arrows on top, demonstrating LoJack's ability to locate vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p>Check out the case study, and below a look at the design of the site's homepage:</p>

                    <h3>Klondikebar.com and the Klondike Flavor Chamber</h3>
                    <p>I was heavily involved in producing both of these sites, working with partners Sapient/Nitro on klondikebar.com and STINK Digital on the Flavor Chamber. In addition to producing, I was the lead manager of QA on both. Each were big efforts to coordinate and
                       create, and each represents a rich and unique digital experience.
